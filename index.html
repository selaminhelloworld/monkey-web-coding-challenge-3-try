            I like this movie because of its atmosphere, its character development, 
            its subplots, its great music. Basically everything is top class. 
            Its has the deepest story amongst the dollar trilogy. 
            The other movies are kind of straight forward compared to this one. 
            Their atmosphere is still worth at least a watch though. 
            This one is so good that the main story is like a substory at some point. 
            It is just what keeps them moving. Just like real life. 
            You have a destination but life swings you to different places where you don't even think about that destination while you are going for it.
